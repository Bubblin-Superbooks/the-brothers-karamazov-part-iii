I fell from the garret that time. The struggling ceased and then began again, and for three days I couldn’t come back to my senses. Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Herzenstube, the doctor here, and he put ice on my head and tried another remedy, too.... I might have died.”</p><p>“But they say one can’t tell with epilepsy when a fit is coming. What makes you say you will have one to‐morrow?” Ivan inquired, with a peculiar, irritable curiosity.</p><p>“That’s just so. You can’t tell beforehand.”</p></div> </div>
