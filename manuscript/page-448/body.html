<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After four years of this life, I chanced to be in the town of K. where our regiment was stationed at the time. We found the people of the town hospitable, rich and fond of entertainments. I met with a cordial reception everywhere, as I was of a lively temperament and was known to be well off, which always goes a long way in the world. And then a circumstance happened which was the beginning of it all.</p><p>I formed an attachment to a beautiful and intelligent young girl of noble and lofty character, the daughter of people much respected. They were well‐to‐do people of influence and position. They always gave me a cordial and friendly reception. I fancied that the young lady looked on me with favor and my heart was aflame at such an idea.</p></div> </div>
