I know too well what Thou wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou hadst said of old. Why, then, art Thou come to hinder us? For Thou hast come to hinder us, and Thou knowest that. But dost Thou know what will be to‐ morrow? I know not who Thou art and care not to know whether it is Thou or only a semblance of Him, but to‐morrow I shall condemn Thee and burn Thee at the stake as the worst of heretics. And the very people who have to‐day kissed Thy feet, to‐morrow at the faintest sign from me will rush to heap up the embers of Thy fire. Knowest Thou that? Yes, maybe Thou knowest it,’ he added with thoughtful penetration, never for a moment taking his eyes off the Prisoner.”</p></div> </div>
