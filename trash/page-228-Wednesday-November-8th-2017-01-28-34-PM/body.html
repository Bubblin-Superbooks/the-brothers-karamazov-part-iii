Make haste, you are needed there, go and wait at the Father Superior’s table.”</p><p>“Let me stay here,” Alyosha entreated.</p><p>“You are more needed there. There is no peace there. You will wait, and be of service. If evil spirits rise up, repeat a prayer. And remember, my son”—the elder liked to call him that—“this is not the place for you in the future. When it is God’s will to call me, leave the monastery. Go away for good.”</p><p>Alyosha started.</p><p>“What is it? This is not your place for the time. I bless you for great service in the world. Yours will be a long pilgrimage. And you will have to take a wife, too. You will have to bear all before you come back. There will be much to do. But I don’t doubt of you, and so I send you forth. Christ is with you.</p></div> </div>
