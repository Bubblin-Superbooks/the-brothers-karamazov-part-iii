Going into the cottage where the clergy were assembled and the visitors had arrived, including Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was to stand god‐ father, he suddenly announced that the baby “ought not to be christened at all.” He announced this quietly, briefly, forcing out his words, and gazing with dull intentness at the priest.</p><p>“Why not?” asked the priest with good‐humored surprise.</p><p>“Because it’s a dragon,” muttered Grigory.</p><p>“A dragon?
