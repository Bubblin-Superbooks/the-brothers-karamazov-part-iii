We’ve arrived,” cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. “The gates are shut.”</p><p>And he repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints painted above and on the sides of the gates.</p><p>“When you go to Rome you must do as the Romans do. Here in this hermitage there are twenty‐five saints being saved. They look at one another, and eat cabbages. And not one woman goes in at this gate. That’s what is remarkable. And that really is so. But I did hear that the elder receives ladies,” he remarked suddenly to the monk.</p><p>“Women of the people are here too now, lying in the portico there waiting. But for ladies of higher rank two rooms have been built adjoining the portico, but outside the precincts—you can see the windows—and the elder goes out to them by an inner passage when he is well enough. They are always outside the precincts.</p></div> </div>
