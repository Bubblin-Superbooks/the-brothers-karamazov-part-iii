<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>“Brother, let me ask one thing more: has any man a right to look at other men and decide which is worthy to live?”</p><p>“Why bring in the question of worth? The matter is most often decided in men’s hearts on other grounds much more natural. And as for rights—who has not the right to wish?”</p><p>“Not for another man’s death?”</p><p>“What even if for another man’s death? Why lie to oneself since all men live so and perhaps cannot help living so. Are you referring to what I said just now—that one reptile will devour the other? In that case let me ask you, do you think me like Dmitri capable of shedding Æsop’s blood, murdering him, eh?”</p></div> </div>
