You’re out of your mind!”</p><p>“Why, isn’t she a relation of yours? I heard so.”</p><p>“Where can you have heard it?

I may be only a priest’s son, and dirt in the eyes of noblemen like you, but don’t insult me so lightly and wantonly. I have a sense of honor, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I couldn’t be a relation of Grushenka, a common harlot. I beg you to understand that!”</p></div> </div>
