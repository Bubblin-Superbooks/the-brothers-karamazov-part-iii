I love the people myself. I want to love them. And who could help loving them, our splendid Russian people, so simple in their greatness!”</p><p>“How is your daughter’s health? You wanted to talk to me again?”</p><p>“Oh, I have been urgently begging for it, I have prayed for it! I was ready to fall on my knees and kneel for three days at your windows until you let me in. We have come, great healer, to express our ardent gratitude. You have healed my Lise, healed her completely, merely by praying over her last Thursday and laying your hands upon her. We have hastened here to kiss those hands, to pour out our feelings and our homage.”</p></div> </div>
