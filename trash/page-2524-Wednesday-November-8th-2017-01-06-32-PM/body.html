Snegiryov is not drunk, we know for a fact he’s had nothing to drink to‐day, but he seems as if he were drunk ... I am always manly, but this is awful. Karamazov, if I am not keeping you, one question before you go in?”</p><p>“What is it, Kolya?” said Alyosha.</p><p>“Is your brother innocent or guilty?
