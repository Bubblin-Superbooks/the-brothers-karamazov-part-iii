<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works.</p><p>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p><p>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p>Each ebook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the ebook’s ebook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p></div> </div>
