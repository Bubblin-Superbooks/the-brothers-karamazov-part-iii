Here Fyodor Pavlovitch will get up directly and begin worrying me every minute, ‘Has she come? Why hasn’t she come?’ and so on up till midnight and even after midnight. And if Agrafena Alexandrovna doesn’t come (for very likely she does not mean to come at all) then he will be at me again to‐morrow morning, ‘Why hasn’t she come? When will she come?’—as though I were to blame for it. On the other side it’s no better. As soon as it gets dark, or even before, your brother will appear with his gun in his hands: ‘Look out, you rogue, you soup‐maker. If you miss her and don’t let me know she’s been—I’ll kill you before any one.’ When the night’s over, in the morning, he, too, like Fyodor Pavlovitch, begins worrying me to death.</p></div> </div>
