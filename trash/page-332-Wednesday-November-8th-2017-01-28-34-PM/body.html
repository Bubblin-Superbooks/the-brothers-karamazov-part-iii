No, I’m going to tell you something more curious; and don’t be surprised that I’m glad to tell you, instead of being ashamed.”</p><p>“You say that because I blushed,” Alyosha said suddenly. “I wasn’t blushing at what you were saying or at what you’ve done. I blushed because I am the same as you are.”</p><p>“You? Come, that’s going a little too far!”</p><p>“No, it’s not too far,” said Alyosha warmly (obviously the idea was not a new one). “The ladder’s the same. I’m at the bottom step, and you’re above, somewhere about the thirteenth. That’s how I see it. But it’s all the same. Absolutely the same in kind. Any one on the bottom step is bound to go up to the top one.”</p></div> </div>
