<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I guess from your warmth that you are not indifferent to Katerina Ivanovna yourself; I’ve suspected that for a long time, brother, that’s why you don’t like my brother Ivan. Are you jealous of him?”</p><p>“And jealous of her money, too? Won’t you add that?”</p><p>“I’ll say nothing about money. I am not going to insult you.”</p><p>“I believe it, since you say so, but confound you, and your brother Ivan with you. Don’t you understand that one might very well dislike him, apart from Katerina Ivanovna. And why the devil should I like him? He condescends to abuse me, you know. Why haven’t I a right to abuse him?”</p></div> </div>
