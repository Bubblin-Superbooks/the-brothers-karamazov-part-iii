I fell in love with the young lady, I worried myself over her and she worried me. I sat watching over her ... and all at once it’s collapsed! I spoke this morning with inspiration, but I went away and roared with laughter. Would you believe it? Yes, it’s the literal truth.”</p><p>“You seem very merry about it now,” observed Alyosha, looking into his face, which had suddenly grown brighter.</p><p>“But how could I tell that I didn’t care for her a bit! Ha ha! It appears after all I didn’t. And yet how she attracted me! How attractive she was just now when I made my speech! And do you know she attracts me awfully even now, yet how easy it is to leave her. Do you think I am boasting?”</p></div> </div>
